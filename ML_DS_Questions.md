## Questions

- Difference between Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning
- What is normal distribution
- Difference between Z-test, T-test and F-test
- Why do we take sum of square in Linear Regression?
- Difference betweence correlation and VIF
- If two variables are correlated, How to decide which one to remove?

- **How does Variance Inflation Factor(VIF) Work?**
  - Regress each of the independent varables w.r.t rest of the independent variables in the model and calculate the R2 for each. Using R2 we can calculate the VIF of each variable i.e. VIF=1/(1-R2). Higher R2 value of independent variable corresponds to the high correlation, means the variable need to be removed.
  
- How does Principal Component Analysis(PCA) works?
- **Effect of Multicollinearity**
  - Moderate multicollinearity may not be problematic. However, severe multicollinearity is a problem because it can increase the variance of the coefficient estimates and make the estimates very sensitive to minor changes in the model. The result is that the coefficient estimates are unstable and difficult to interpret. Multicollinearity saps the statistical power of the analysis, can cause the coefficients to switch signs, and makes it more difficult to specify the correct model.
  
- **How PCA take cares of multicollinearity**
  - As Principle components are orthogonal to ech other which helps in to get rid of multicollineraity
  
- Why the Principal components are othogonal to each other?
- Difference between PCA and Random Forest for feature selection.
- How to explain gain and lift to business person?
- How you will define Precision
- **What is Gradient Descent**
  - Gradient descent is used to minimize the cost function or any other function

- How to perform clustering on large dataset?
- How the recommendation system work if I don't like/dislike the any movies (in case of Netflix), just simply watch the movies there then, How the rating will be given (means the User vector is defined)?



- How to read multiple files in one command in R?
- Difference between sapply(), lapply and tapply()
